## General Structure 
The structure of PyRaman is remotely based on OriginLab. 
It consists of three main parts framed in red in the
following picture; a menu bar at the top a side tree at the 
left and a workspace containing the open windows.
The windows are organized in folders, so that the workspace only
shows the windows of the selected folder. You can switch between 
folders by clicking at another folder at the side tree or by 
changing the tab of the workspace.
