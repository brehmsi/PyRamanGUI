# Description
Provide a general purpose tool for RAMAN spectra evaluation
  - structure similar to Origin 
  - use of spreadsheets and plotting windows
  - projects can be saved and loaded
  - general-purpose background fitting procedure 
  - RAMAN spectra database 
  - increased reproducibiliy of fitting processes 
# Install 
The code needs following packages 
  - pandas 
  - sympy
  - PyQT5 ( pip3 install PyQt5==5.12.2) 
  - tabulate  
# Acknowledgement 
Thanks go to our supervisors Prof. Jens Kortus as well as Dr. Camilu Himchinski. 
The spectra evaluated by two of us, SB and JaK, are part of the SFB 920 
and hopefully can help to prodivde further insights in the structure of 
filter materials.
