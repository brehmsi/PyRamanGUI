  - Author: Simon Brehm (Email: simon.brehm@physik.tu-freiberg.de) 
  - Coding language: Python 

# Description
Provides a general purpose tool for Raman spectra evaluation
  - structure similar to Origin 
  - use of spreadsheets and plotting windows
  - projects can be saved and loaded
  - general-purpose background fitting procedure
  - increased reproducibility of fitting processes 
  
A tutorial on how to use PyRamanGui can be found here [Tutorial](doc/README.md)

# Installation
## Linux
Open a terminal and go to the directory where you want to clone the files.
Run the following command. Git automatically creates a folder with the repository name and downloads the files there.
```
git clone https://gitlab.com/brehmsi/PyRamanGUI.git
```

Change directory to source files
```
cd pyramangui/src
```


Run PyRamanGUI
```
python3 pyramangui.py
```

## Windows
Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution). Make sure to enable the 'Add Anaconda to the system 
PATH environment variable' box during installation. Otherwise, PyRamanGui can't find the python executable installed 
by Anaconda.

Copy the PyRamanGui directory to a path you have chosen. To run PyRamanGui double-click the 'WindowsRun.bat' file
